# ITI1121-2025: Lecture 20

Welcome to the **Lecture 20** repository for **ITI1121 (Introduction to Computing II, 2025)**. This lecture focuses on **linked list data structures**, including singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular doubly linked lists.

## 📂 Repository Structure

| File Name                     | Description |
|------------------------------|-------------|
| `CircularDoublyLinkedList.java` | Implements a circular doubly linked list with bi-directional circular navigation. |
| `DoublyLinkedList.java`         | Basic implementation of a doubly linked list. |
| `DoublyLinkedList1.java`        | Variant 1 of doubly linked list implementation. |
| `DoublyLinkedList2.java`        | Variant 2 of doubly linked list implementation. |
| `SinglyLinkedList.java`         | Basic singly linked list implementation. |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or later
- Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse, VS Code) or terminal with `javac` and `java`

### Compilation & Execution

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kamranghz/ITI1121-2025.git
   cd ITI1121-2025/Lecture-20
   ```

2. Compile the Java files:
   ```bash
   javac *.java
   ```

3. Run a specific demo class (replace with actual class containing `main()` method):
   ```bash
   java DoublyLinkedList   # or whichever file contains your main method
   ```

## 📖 Concepts Covered

- 📌 **Singly Linked Lists**: Nodes pointing in one direction.
- 📌 **Doubly Linked Lists**: Nodes with both next and previous pointers.
- 📌 **Circular Doubly Linked Lists**: Circular navigation between nodes in both directions.
- 📌 **Linked List Variants**: Understanding multiple approaches to linked list design.
