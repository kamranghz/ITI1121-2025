# ITI1121-2025: Lecture 16

Welcome to the **Lecture 16** repository for **ITI1121 (Introduction to Computing II, 2025)**. This repository contains Java source files related to queue data structures, including general and special case insertions and removals.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

The repository includes the following Java source files:

| File Name                      | Description |
|--------------------------------|-------------|
| `QueueExample.java`            | Demonstrates basic queue operations. |
| `QueueGeneralInsertion.java`   | Implements general case insertion in a queue. |
| `QueueSpecialCaseInsertion.java` | Implements a special case of queue insertion. |
| `RemoveGeneralQueue.java`      | Implements general case removal from a queue. |
| `SpecialCaseQueue.java`        | Demonstrates special case scenarios in queue operations. |

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or later.
- A Java-compatible IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code) or a terminal with `javac` and `java` commands available.

### Compilation & Execution

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/kamranghz/ITI1121-2025.git
   cd ITI1121-2025/Lecture-16
   ```

2. Compile the Java files:
   ```sh
   javac *.java
   ```

3. Run the main class (replace `MainClass` with the actual entry point class):
   ```sh
   java MainClass
   ```

## ðŸ“– Concepts Covered
- **Queue Data Structure**: Implementation of queue operations such as enqueue and dequeue.
- **General vs. Special Cases**: Understanding different insertion and removal cases.
- **Algorithmic Efficiency**: Analyzing the efficiency of queue operations.
