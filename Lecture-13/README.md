# ITI1121-2025 - Lecture 13

This repository contains Java source code for **Lecture 13** of the ITI1121 (Introduction to Computing II) course.

## ðŸ“‚ Files Included

- **FactorialStackSimulation.java** â€“ Simulates the stack behavior of recursive factorial computation.
- **RecursiveFactorial.java** â€“ Implements factorial computation using recursion.

## ðŸ“– Overview

The code in this repository is designed to help understand **recursion** and **stack behavior** in Java:

1. **RecursiveFactorial.java**:
   - Implements a basic recursive function to compute the factorial of a number.
   - Demonstrates the concept of **base case** and **recursive calls**.

2. **FactorialStackSimulation.java**:
   - Simulates how function calls are pushed onto and popped from the **call stack**.
   - Helps visualize the **execution flow** of recursive methods.

## ðŸ”§ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/kamranghz/ITI1121-2025.git
