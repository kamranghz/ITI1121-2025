# Java Programming Concepts: Call-by-Value, Scope, and References

This repository contains a collection of Java programs that demonstrate fundamental programming concepts such as **Call-by-Value**, **Scope Management**, and **Object References** in Java. Each file is carefully documented with detailed explanations and examples to help developers and learners better understand these critical concepts.

## Contents

1. **CallByValueWithReferences.java**  
   Demonstrates Java's Call-by-Value mechanism for object references and how changes to an object's fields reflect in the original object.

2. **CalledByValue1.java**  
   Shows how primitive data types are passed by value, with an example of comparing two points for equality using integer coordinates.

3. **CalledByValue2.java**  
   Demonstrates Call-by-Value with object references, including comparison and addition of points represented as objects.

4. **FormalAndActualParameters.java**  
   Explains the difference between formal and actual parameters in Java, showing how values are passed to a method.

5. **Scope Management Examples:**
   - **ScopeExample1.java:** Demonstrates variable scope within nested blocks.
   - **ScopeExample2.java:** Explains variable scope within conditional statements.
   - **ScopeExample3.java:** Highlights errors caused by variable scope.
   - **ScopeExample4.java:** Demonstrates issues with variable access across methods.
   - **ScopeExample5.java:** Explains variable scope within loops.

6. **Test.java**  
   Explores object references and reassignment, showcasing garbage collection when an object is no longer referenced.
