# ITI1121-2025: Lecture 18

Welcome to the **Lecture 18** repository for **ITI1121 (Introduction to Computing II, 2025)**. This repository contains Java source files related to search algorithms, problem-solving techniques, and simulations.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

The repository includes the following Java source files:

| File Name                          | Description |
|------------------------------------|-------------|
| `BFSBinaryGenerator.java`         | Implements a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to generate binary numbers. |
| `DepthFirstSearch.java`           | Implements depth-first search (DFS) for graph traversal. |
| `MazeSolver.java`                 | Uses search algorithms to solve a maze. |
| `SupermarketQueueSimulation.java` | Simulates a queue system in a supermarket scenario. |

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or later.
- A Java-compatible IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code) or a terminal with `javac` and `java` commands available.

### Compilation & Execution

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/kamranghz/ITI1121-2025.git
   cd ITI1121-2025/Lecture-18
   ```

2. Compile the Java files:
   ```sh
   javac *.java
   ```

3. Run the main class (replace `MainClass` with the actual entry point class):
   ```sh
   java MainClass
   ```

## ðŸ“– Concepts Covered
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Traversing graphs layer by layer.
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Exploring graph nodes deeply before backtracking.
- **Maze Solving**: Applying search techniques to find a path in a maze.
- **Queue Simulations**: Modeling real-world queue-based systems like supermarket checkouts.
