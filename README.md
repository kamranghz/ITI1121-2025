Lecture 2 - Summary of Today's Code
Description:
This folder contains the source code and examples from Lecture 2 of the ITI1121-2025 course. The code demonstrates key concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP) in Java, including the following:

Primitive vs. Reference Types: Understanding memory allocation for primitive and reference variables, with visual diagrams illustrating stack and heap memory usage.
Object-Oriented Programming Basics:
Implementation of a custom MyInteger class to explore class structures, constructors, and object instantiation.
Differences in memory behavior between primitive data types (int) and objects in Java.
Practical Example:
Incrementing values of primitive and object types.
Using multiple references (aliasing) pointing to the same object.
Demonstrating shared object behavior in the heap.
This example emphasizes the importance of understanding Java's memory management to effectively design efficient and maintainable software.

How to Run:

Clone the repository and navigate to the Lecture-2 folder.
Compile the Java code using javac MyInteger.java.
Run the program with java MyInteger to see the output in the terminal.
