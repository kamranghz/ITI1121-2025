## Key Files and Descriptions

### 1. **`ByteMultiplicationExamples.java`**
   - Demonstrates byte arithmetic in Java.
   - Highlights how Java handles **overflow** and **type promotion** during operations involving the `byte` data type.
   - Provides practical examples of multiplication with small integers.

### 2. **`Constant - gc.java` and `Constant.java`**
   - Explains how to define constants in Java using the `final` keyword.
   - **`Constant - gc.java`**: Focuses on constants in a garbage-collected context.
   - Showcases the importance of immutability and good practices for defining constants in Java.

### 3. **`MyInteger.java`**
   - Custom implementation of an `Integer`-like class.
   - Demonstrates how to create and use custom classes to manage integer values.
   - Includes examples of encapsulation and methods for managing and manipulating integer values.

### 4. **`PrimitiveTypesExample.java`**
   - Explains the use of **primitive types** (`int`, `double`, `float`, `byte`, `char`, etc.).
   - Provides examples of how primitive types are stored in memory and how they differ from reference types.
   - Demonstrates operations and limitations of primitives.

### 5. **`ReferenceTypes.java`**
   - Covers the concept of **reference types** in Java (e.g., objects, arrays).
   - Explains the difference between **stack** and **heap** memory.
   - Provides examples of how Java handles references, nullability, and memory management.
